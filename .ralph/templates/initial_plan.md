You are creating an initial implementation plan.

    TASK:
    $original_prompt

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Analyze the task and break it down into concrete implementation steps
    2. Create implementation_plan.md with prioritized tasks
    3. Focus on a logical progression from foundation to completion

    TASK PLANNING:
    - Break the task into manageable sub-tasks
    - Identify dependencies between tasks
    - Prioritize tasks that enable subsequent work
    - Consider testing, documentation, and software engineering standards
    - Do NOT over-specify with irrelevant information

    PLAN FORMAT:
    # Implementation Plan

    ## Tasks

    ### TASK_NAME

    - Status: Pending
    - Description: TASK_DESCRIPTION
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        - CRITERION_1
        - CRITERION_2
        - CRITERION_3

    ## Dependencies
    Note any task dependencies or prerequisites

    OUTPUT: Create implementation_plan.md with your plan
